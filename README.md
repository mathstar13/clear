Clear can be used to clear the screen in the python console.
To use:
First:
```
pip install clearconsole
```
Next:
```python
from clearconsole import clear
import time
print('Example')
time.sleep(2)
clear()
```
or:
```python
from clearconsole import cls
import time
print('Example')
time.sleep(2)
cls()
```
It does not matter what system you're on.
